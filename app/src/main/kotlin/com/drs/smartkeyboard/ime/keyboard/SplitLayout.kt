/**
 * DRS v1.18.0: split keyboard mode — when active, the character keyboard
 * is laid out in two halves with a vertical gap in the middle of every
 * row, so thumbs reach both edges comfortably on wide screens (landscape
 * phones, foldables, tablets) instead of stretching across the full width.
 *
 * The decision logic is fully pure and unit-tested; the rendering side
 * (TextKeyboard.layout) receives a computed gap in pixels and inserts it
 * after the row's midpoint key, in both the grow and the shrink branch,
 * so the split composes with every existing width factor and margin rule.
