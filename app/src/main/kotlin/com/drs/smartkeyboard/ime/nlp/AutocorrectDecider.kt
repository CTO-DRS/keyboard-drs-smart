/**
 * DRS v1.17.0: the pure decider behind TRUE autocorrect. Until now no
 * candidate was ever marked auto-commit eligible, so pressing space
 * always committed the typo verbatim. This decider gates the (already
 * existing) auto-commit plumbing conservatively — an auto-fix may fire
 * ONLY when every one of these holds:
 *
 *  1. the user typed a full word candidate of at least [MIN_WORD_LENGTH]
 *     letters (no single/two-letter "fixes", no mid-word firing);
 *  2. the typed word is NOT a prefix of any dictionary word (i.e. the
 *     provider served its "did you mean?" fallback — the word is a real
 *     typo, not just an uncommon inflection);
 *  3. the correction is a known word with a frequency of at least
 *     [MIN_CORRECTION_FREQ] (out of 255) — only very common words earn
 *     the right to silently replace what the user typed;
 *  4. the caller already honored session guards (password fields,
 *     incognito) by passing [enabled] = pref AND safe session.
 *
 * Pure and JVM-testable; the provider owns the actual candidate marking.
