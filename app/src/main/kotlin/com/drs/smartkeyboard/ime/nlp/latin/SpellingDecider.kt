 * DRS v1.19.0: pure, testable decision engine for real spell-check typo marking.
 *
 * Until now [LatinLanguageProvider.spell] unconditionally returned
 * `SpellingResult.validWord()`, so the fully-wired DrsSpellCheckerService could
 * never mark a single misspelling system-wide — a dead channel behind ~180
 * advertised locale subtypes. The engine ships real marking now, but the
 * project's core honesty rule stands: «المجهول لا ينذر كاذبًا» (the unknown
 * never warns falsely). Both functions below therefore encode deliberately
 * conservative gates; every gate is unit-tested.
