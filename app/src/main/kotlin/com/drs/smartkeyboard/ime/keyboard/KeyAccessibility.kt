/**
 * DRS v1.17.0: accessibility support for the keyboard. Until this file
 * existed the keys were unlabeled boxes as far as TalkBack was concerned —
 * explore-by-touch announced nothing, because icon keys render no text and
 * the renderer passed `contentDescription = null`.
 *
 * [keyA11yLabelRes] maps the icon-only key codes (which carry no visible
 * label) to localized spoken labels. Character keys do NOT need this —
 * their visible label IS their description. Pure function, JVM-tested.
