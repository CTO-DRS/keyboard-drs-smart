/**
 * DRS v1.27.0: human-readable SPDX license names — «الترخيص بلغة
 * الناس». The extension manifest stores the license as an SPDX
 * identifier or expression ([ExtensionMeta.license] — the machine
 * truth, exactly what the SPDX spec demands), but the extension view
 * screen should not greet a normal user with "Apache-2.0" when the
 * world knows that license as the Apache License 2.0.
 *
 * The map covers the identifiers that actually appear in the wild for
 * keyboard extensions and their bundled libraries. The official
 * license titles are proper nouns and stay in English — translating a
 * legal name would be neither honest nor useful. Any identifier the
 * map does not know falls through untouched: a raw SPDX id is the
 * honest answer when no official title is known, never a made-up one.

/**
 * Renders [spdx] for the extension view screen. Pure — JVM-tested.
 *
 * SPDX expressions are honored on their own operators: each operand
 * between `OR` / `AND` / `WITH` is mapped independently, operators and
 * parentheses are preserved verbatim, and matching is case-insensitive
 * (the spec's identifiers are exact, but manifests are written by
 * humans and "mit" happens). A blank input comes back as-is.
